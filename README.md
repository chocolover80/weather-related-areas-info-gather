This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The application aims to collect weather data for the 15 surrounding locations, based on a latitude and longitude of a city passed. It's connected with Google Maps API and OpenWeather Map.

Project developed by: [Luan Lucas Brevinski (chocolover80)](https://github.com/chocolover80).

## To start up the project
To run the project, you must first install the dependencies. with a simple 'npm install' command. After running the command just wait for it to finish (takes up to 2 minutes depending on your PC) and start hacking! :)

## Available Scripts

As told above, the project was generated via Create React App, so the default scripts were kept, with just some environment changes. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:<env_port_declared_on_env_file>]() to view it in the browser. Here I used a PORT declaration via .env file, it can be found on the 
 [.env inside the project](https://github.com/chocolover80/weather-related-areas-info-gather/blob/main/.env)
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

** The test and build scripts are also available, but they're not relevant for this POC, so no need to concern about it. For more info, see the [package.json](https://github.com/chocolover80/weather-related-areas-info-gather/blob/main/package.json) of the project. **

## Coding structure
The project is a simple POC, but yet, it uses great and very famous libraries, so in order for them to work together some
